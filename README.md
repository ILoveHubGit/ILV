Are you tired of trying to understand the complex web of connections between the various systems in your organization? Do you struggle to keep track of how each system fits into the bigger picture?

This tool is here to help! It takes in information about the links between the various systems in your organization through a simple API interface, and automatically generates a visually appealing graph that clearly illustrates the relationships between the different systems. No more sifting through confusing spreadsheets or trying to make sense of disorganized documentation - the graph provides a simple and intuitive way to understand the landscape of your organization's systems.

And that's not all - this tool also gives you the ability to export the landscape in table format to a PDF, making it easy to share with your colleagues or keep a record of the relationships between the systems. Plus, with the API interface, it's easy to integrate my tool into your existing workflow and keep your system landscape up to date.

This tool is easy to use and requires no technical expertise to understand. Simply input your information through the API interface and let the tool do the rest. You'll be able to clearly see the relationships between the different systems, giving you a better understanding of how they all fit together.

## Prerequisites
Have Java version 11 or above installed

## Running
Request a zip-file via [my LinkedIn account][1]
 - Unzip the file in any folder
 - Open the file config.edn
   - You can now change the port number or leave it at 3000
   - Choose what kind of database you want to use and remove the ;; before these lines and configure the line with the name and server
     - Make sure that you do this for both lines starting with :database-url and :migration-dir belonging to one database format

Currently three databases are supported:
 - H2 (database is created if it does not exist)
 - MS-SQL (Database needs to be created before running migration command)
 - MariaDB (Database needs to be created before running migration command)


If you run this application for the first time you need to run the following command to create the database structure:

    java -Dconf=config.edn -jar ilv.jar migrate

After this the application can be started with the following command:

    java -Dconf=config.edn -jar ilv.jar

Then open your browser and goto http://localhost:port and you should see the application. Configure your network settings in such a way that the server you installed this tool on can be reach via HTTP with the port number you configured. Open necessary ports in your firewall and make sure that the server is reachable from the outside by using a DNS name.
